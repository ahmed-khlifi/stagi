# Stagi

Stagi is an online platform that allows students to find internships and allow companies to share opportunities.

# Overview
**Problem**

I noticed that students having a hard time finding and applying for internships and companies may find it hard to filter out all internships requests...

**Solution**

an online platform that puts both parties in contact very easily to gain time and energy, and companies can post what they exactly need and only matching profiles will be interviewed or accepted. Students will easily find companies in their field with a quick search query.
